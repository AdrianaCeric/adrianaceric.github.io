    <br><br>

    <h3><mark>Case Overview</mark></h3>

    <p>The pandemic has sparked a stark surge of mental health issues; especially with many of us being cooped up at home. I noticed my peers weren't feeling our 100% during lockdown, so I felt it was crucial to partake in this project.</p>

    <h3><mark>Context</mark></h3>

    <p>Mindly is a small non-profit organization based in Ontario, Canada, working towards providing virtual mental health resources based on user demographics and needs. Mindly's founder was hiring volunteers to help design their website and mobile app, and I took on the role for around two months.</p>

      </div>

      <h3><mark>Considerations/Wireframes</mark></h3>
      <p>The overarching mission of the app was to make "mental health accessible", so I decided it was a good idea to carry this concept of accessibility throughout my design. Here's what I did to make this work:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrasting colors: A dark blue and white palette was used throughout to easily deliver every message. The colors alone didn't convey any message, so those with colorblindness could still understand. For example, text was used on the filter tags along with their distinguishing colors to accommodate this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Large buttons with visible, contrasting text.
            </li>
            <li>
                A simple, clean layout. Short sentences and simple graphics were designed on the on-boarding screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Icons and arrows as navigation pointers
            </li>
            <li>
                Large, sans serif font. (I chose Poppins)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <img src ="img/wire.png">
        <br><br>

        <p>Why was accessibility one of my priorities in this design? I empathized with the user; if they were to scroll through an app like this, they would most likely be in a state of distress, shame or anger. I had to consider the user's mental impediments along with any possible physical ones. So, I designed the app to have as few steps and as much clarity as possible.</p>
